# Chain of Responsibility — The Functional Way

This repository contains code examples for the tutorial
article titled "Chain of Responsibility — The Functional
Way." In this tutorial, we explore the concept of the Chain
of Responsibility design pattern using catamorphisms and the
first monoid in a functional programming context.

The tutorial is divided into three main sections, each of
which corresponds to an executable script included in this
repository.

## Running the Code

To run the code examples in this repository, you'll need
npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devfull/catamorphism.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd catamorphism
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the code examples for each section as follows:
   - List catamorphism with first monoid:
     ```bash
     npm run option
     ```
   - Generalization to asynchronous handler:
     ```bash
     npm run taskoption
     ```
   - Collecting handler errors:
     ```bash
     npm run validation
     ```

Each script will execute the code related to its respective
section of the tutorial.
